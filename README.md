# Space Wars in Megalactica

Refactoring and extending a command line game in Java using Test Driven Development. 
The aims of this project were to use good software engineering practices as well as object-oriented 
development techniques to improve the design of the program.

Some aims included, but were not limited to:
* Extend the program as per the [specification](https://github.com/Aston13/SWIM/blob/master/SWIM%20Specification.doc).
* Minimise code duplication and be modularised so that components have low coupling and high cohesion. 
* Use inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces, as appropriate.
* Be reusable and easy to maintain.
* Be well documented, displaying both agreed standards of internal documentation and good use of the facilities available in Javadoc.

## Notable Implementations

* Used JUnit Tests for TDD.
* Extended the basic features of the game (Forces and Battles).
* Improved UI.
* Refactored the command pattern for user input.
* Added a save and load facility.
* Extended rules of the game through methods.

## Built With

* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html) - Programming language.
* [NetBeans 8.2](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/) - IDE.
